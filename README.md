## All online color converters suck

They are covered in ads and inflexible in their input and output.  

Some of them even moronically post data off to a server and do a page refresh to show you the result.

Like it's 1997 or something.

## This one doesn't.

Here, it's a single input box where you type commands like


    rgb2hsl #432123

    hex2rgb #ab3s34

    hsv2hex 34 53 12

And bam, it's done.

## Syntax

We break it down as follows:


    (LHS) 2 (RHS) (Arguments)

Where LHS and RHS is one of

    rgb
    hex
    hsv
    hsl

and arguments are either one of

 * a hex color in the form of #aabbcc
 * 3 numbers between 0 and 256
 * 3 floating point numbers between 0 and 1

And that's it.
